      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m picky when it comes to stuff like this. I&amp;rsquo;d settled on Hugo since i had prior knowledge of how to use it, more so than jekyll. But the hard part was choosing a theme, in the end I decided to rice a theme I liked but wasn&amp;rsquo;t fully sold on and made my own.
The theme is still blog-focused but I overrode its homepage for this site.
Next I looked at how i would deploy it, Github Pages was an easy choice for a broke Indian student, but do I make a separate repo for the pre-build files and final site?</description>
