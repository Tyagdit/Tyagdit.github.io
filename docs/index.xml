      <description>I was fortunate enough to be a part of Google Summer of Code 2020 with matrix. I worked on Opsdroid with Stuart Mumford and Drew Leonard as my mentors. Opsdroid is a python framework for creating platform agnostic bots usable with multiple chat services including matrix.
The Plan The project&amp;rsquo;s focus was on the interaction layer (called a connector) between opsdroid and matrix. As it stood, the connector used the deprecated matrix-python-sdk and had no support for encryption.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m picky when it comes to stuff like this. I&amp;rsquo;d settled on Hugo since I had prior knowledge of how to use it, more so than jekyll. But the hard part was choosing a theme, in the end I decided to rice a theme I liked but wasn&amp;rsquo;t fully sold on and made my own.
The theme is still blog-focused but I overrode its homepage for this site.
Next I looked at how I would deploy it, Github Pages was an easy choice for a broke Indian student, but do I make a separate repo for the pre-build files and final site?</description>
