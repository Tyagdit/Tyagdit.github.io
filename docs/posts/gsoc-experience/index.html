<h1>My Experience with GSoC 2020</h1>

Sep. 8, 2020


<br/><br/>
<p>I was fortunate enough to be a part of Google Summer of Code 2020 with
<a href="https://matrix.org">matrix</a>. I worked on
<a href="https://github.com/opsdroid/opsdroid">Opsdroid</a> with <a href="https://github.com/Cadair">Stuart
Mumford</a> and <a href="https://github.com/SolarDrew">Drew
Leonard</a> as my mentors. Opsdroid is a python
framework for creating platform agnostic bots usable with multiple chat services
including matrix.</p>
<h2 id="the-plan">The Plan</h2>
<p>The project&rsquo;s focus was on the interaction layer (called a connector) between
opsdroid and matrix. As it stood, the connector used the deprecated
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-python-sdk">matrix-python-sdk</a> and had no
support for encryption. The aim was to change this by moving over to
<a href="https://github.com/poljar/matrix-nio">matrix-nio</a>.</p>
<p>I had planned to work on some other features as well:</p>
<ul>
<li>A database module for opsdroid using matrix state events</li>
<li>Support for unused matrix events</li>
<li>Homeserver lookup using <code>.well-known</code> API requests</li>
<li>Device verification process for the bot</li>
</ul>
<p>Porting to nio and adding encryption support was the bulk of the project, and
the <strong>minimum</strong> I wanted to accomplish by the end of the project. I wanted to
have a connector that worked as it did already with support for encrypted rooms
which needed minimal extra configuration.</p>
<h2 id="the-process">The Process</h2>
<p>The process began with <a href="https://github.com/opsdroid/opsdroid/pull/1418">This PR</a>
which gave us a head start with the migration to matrix-nio. Through helping to
review the PR I got to understand how matrix-nio and opsdroid work.</p>
<p>The implementation of encryption support was a little tricky in that it was
tough to figure out the process required to do that in the context of the
connector. One problem we faced was the installation of dependencies. Installing
<code>libolm</code>, a C library which nio uses for encryption was a less than smooth
process. This spawned a couple side projects that dealt with the CI, testing and
installation of opsdroid. In the end we found a solution and had a working
connector on our hands.</p>
<p>Next we shifted focus to the database module. It was based on <a href="https://github.com/SolarDrew/database-matrix">this
project</a>. I rewrote it with nio
and added a few features. The idea was straightforward but the implementation
had many catches since we were working under some constraints for the
interfacing with opsdroid. It went through several iterations before we settled
on the final product.</p>
<p>The encryption and database took longer than I had initially expected which
meant we didn&rsquo;t get to work on adding support for more events and homeserver
lookups. I had a go at adding device verification steps while working on the
encryption support but that turned out to be quite complicated and would
introduce some breaking changes, besides cross-signing had just been introduced
so we decided to drop that till nio implemented some way to leverage
cross-signing.</p>
<p>Along the way some issues cropped up with the testing frameworks and CI that
were hard to pinpoint and caused further delays but were solved eventually.</p>
<h2 id="the-conclusion">The Conclusion</h2>
<p>I am extremely happy with what I&rsquo;ve accomplished and hope that I have been able
to achieve the standards set by the matrix community. It was a challenging and
exhilarating experience. I have learned more in this project than I could&rsquo;ve
imagined and gained a ton of invaluable experience with software development
thanks to my mentors who pushed me forward and guided me throughout. This
journey was beyond amazing and I will be sure to contribute to matrix moving
forward.</p>
