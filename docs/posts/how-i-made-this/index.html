<h1>How I Made This Site</h1>

Sep. 6, 2020


<br/><br/>
<p>I&rsquo;m picky when it comes to stuff like this. I&rsquo;d settled on Hugo since I had
prior knowledge of how to use it, more so than jekyll. But the hard part was
choosing a theme, in the end I decided to rice a theme I liked but wasn&rsquo;t fully
sold on and made <a href="https://github.com/Tyagdit/hugo-theme-console">my own</a>.</p>
<p>The theme is still blog-focused but I overrode its homepage for this site.</p>
<p>Next I looked at how I would deploy it, Github Pages was an easy choice for a
broke Indian student, but do I make a separate repo for the pre-build files and
final site? How do I sync those? Do I have to manage multiple repos for this?
There must be a way to automate this, thought a broke Indian programmer. I
looked at Github Actions for Hugo but turns out there&rsquo;s an easier way.</p>
<p>In the repo settings I can choose which directory from the repo my site deploys
from (sort of, there&rsquo;s just root/ and docs/). A couple tweaks to the config and
that&rsquo;s that. One shell script to streamline this process later, voila, <strong>you</strong>
get to cringe at this article!</p>
